# Read Selected Text

**Select text in any app, press a hotkey, hear it read aloud.**

A tiny, cross-platform desktop app that lives in your system tray and reads your
selected text out loud — in any application or website — using OpenAI,
ElevenLabs, or your computer's built-in voice.

## Why

If you read a lot of documentation, articles, or long threads, letting your ears
do some of the work saves your eyes and helps you power through. This app makes
that a one-key habit: **highlight → hotkey → listen**, everywhere on your
computer, with no copy-paste into a website.

## How it works

1. You select text anywhere — a browser, a PDF, your IDE, a chat window.
2. You press the global hotkey (default **Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + R**).
3. The app copies the selection, sends it to your chosen voice engine, and plays
   the audio. Press **Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + S** to stop.

It runs quietly in the tray and can start automatically at login.

## Voice engines

| Engine              | API key | Cost            | Quality          | Offline |
| ------------------- | :-----: | --------------- | ---------------- | :-----: |
| **OpenAI TTS**      |   Yes   | ~$15 / 1M chars | Very natural     |   No    |
| **ElevenLabs**      |   Yes   | Plan-based      | Most human       |   No    |
| **Local HD (Piper)**|   No    | **Free**        | Good & natural   |   Yes   |
| **System voice**    |   No    | Free            | Basic/robotic    |   Yes   |

**Local HD** is a free neural voice ([Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper))
that runs entirely on your machine. The engine and your chosen voice (~50 MB)
download once on first use, then work offline with no key and no cost.

Pick whichever you like in Settings and switch anytime. Your API keys are stored
in the operating system's secure keychain — never in a plaintext file.

## Install

Download the installer for your platform from the
[**Releases**](https://github.com/harshalnarkhede/read-selected-text/releases) page:

- **Windows** — `.msi` or `.exe` (NSIS)
- **macOS** — `.dmg` (universal)
- **Linux** — `.AppImage` or `.deb`

Then open the app, choose a voice engine, paste your API key (if needed), and
you're set. See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for a step-by-step guide, API-key
instructions, and platform permission notes.

> **macOS note:** the app needs **Accessibility** permission to send the copy
> keystroke. macOS will prompt you on first use — see the setup guide.

## Build from source

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the
[Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs), plus the platform prerequisites listed in
the [Tauri docs](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshalnarkhede/read-selected-text.git
cd read-selected-text
npm install
npm run dev      # run in development
npm run build    # produce installers in src-tauri/target/release/bundle
```

More detail in [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Tech stack

- **[Tauri 2](https://tauri.app)** — tiny, secure desktop shell (Rust core)
- Rust backend: global hotkeys, clipboard capture, secure key storage, audio
- Plain HTML/CSS/JS settings UI (no framework, no build step)

## Privacy

- Text you read is sent **only** to the voice provider **you** choose (OpenAI or
  ElevenLabs). The System voice engine is fully offline.
- API keys live in your OS keychain (Keychain / Credential Manager / Secret
  Service).
- No telemetry, no accounts, no servers of our own.
